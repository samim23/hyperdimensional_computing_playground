# Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) Playground

This notebook is a hands-on exploration of [Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperdimensional_computing) created by [Samim](https://samim.io) for learning and experimentation purposes.

**In this notebook, you'll find:**

1. A very simple HDC toy example: A quick introduction to the basics of hyperdimensional computing.
2. A simple HDC MNIST encoding and reconstruction example: Demonstrating how hypervectors can represent and reconstruct handwritten digits.
3. A simple HDC TinyImageNet encoding and reconstruction example: Scaling up HDC to handle encoding and reconstruction of images, features and labels from a larger, more complex dataset.
4. An intermediate HDC TinyImageNet encoding and reconstruction example, leveraging techniques like circular convolution, permutation, and sparse hypervectors for efficiency
